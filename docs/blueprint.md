# **App Name**: Risky Revelations

## Core Features:

- Truth/Dare Selection: Provides options for the user to select either 'Truth' or 'Dare'.
- Dynamic Question/Dare Generation: Generative AI "tool" dynamically selects an appropriate truth question or dare based on the selected difficulty level and maturity setting. When generating an appropriate response, the tool can and will include material related to the level selected by the user (either 18+ or general).
- Difficulty and Maturity Settings: A slider to set the "difficulty level", governing the nature of questions and dares, ranging from mild to wild. Also an on/off switch to enable "18+" mode to generate more adult content.
- Progressive Intensity: Implement a mechanism that slightly adjusts the tone and content of the truth/dare responses as the game progresses, simulating an increase in intensity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#9400D3), inspired by the game's mix of fun and danger, for interactive elements and headers.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated variant of the primary color, creating a calm yet intriguing backdrop.
- Accent color: Hot pink (#FF69B4), adds a flirtatious touch for CTAs and highlights, catching the user's attention.
- Font: (As before), clean and modern, ensuring easy readability while adding a layer of sophistication.
- Simple, suggestive icons that enhance the mood, hinting at the nature of the questions or dares.
- Clean, modern layout with clear sections for the question/dare display and the difficulty/maturity settings.
- Subtle, suggestive animations when revealing a truth or dare, such as a slow fade-in or a pulsating glow.
